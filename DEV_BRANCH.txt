This is the development branch of the application
for testing of new features and optimizations to improve performance.

To switch back to the main branch

1. Close the application if it is currently running
2. Open the folder E:\tools\APSAP\APSAP_Sherd_Matching_Tool in windows explorer
3. Right-click anywhere in the folder and select "Git Bash here"
4. In the command line window that comes up type "git checkout matrix". 
   You may then close this command line.

The folder will switch back to the main production branch.

To switch back to this development branch, perform the same procedure but
instead type "git checkout speedup" in the Git Bash window.
